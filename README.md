I've decided to create a Pokemon-orientated program which allows both battlemode ("Pokemon Catcher X") and a pokedex feature.

Within both of these segments of my code I aim to use many differing animations, each unique and depending on chance, as pokemon always does.
There will be half a chance for each animation, allowing it to be perfectly fair.

I was glad to find tkinter to create my GUI, which gave a much more satisfying result than simply asking for inputs via the basic pop-up window.
I decided to use one window and to pack/unpack each element as I saw fit, allowing for a smooth-running gui which provided no errors since the options were given to the user.
There were no chances for errors, through my use of buttons on the GUI instead of a text field, which must be checked against its data type and handled appropriatley when
a wrong output was provided.

As you can see, there is a gap in the time I updated my repsoitory due to catching COVID for two and a bit weeks, I also missed other lessons that I'm currently trying to catch up on,
since the grading is based on daily uploads to the repository, I hope you can understand my unfortunate situation.

In all, I've used 8 unique animations as it applied to the flow of the game and situation, which as previously mentioned was influenced by chance and random number generation.
I completed 870 lines to accomplish this task, and also made use of Tkinter GUI functions.

I have submitted late due to a power outage that has affected my area since 2pm, I would have otherwised submited by video and repository links on time.
I hope you are able to understand these elements were completley out of my control.
I even tried to run my PC off of my phone hotspot, but since I live virtually in a forest, data is unable to be used within my house.
I was also unable to go to uni due to storm warnings in my area
